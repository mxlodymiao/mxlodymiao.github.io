						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I've learned about Gestalt principles before in psychology classes, but never understood how to apply the information.
								This article was helpful in pointing out ways that we could utilize Gestalt principles in our designs to make 
								designs make sense visually. I enjoyed how they illustrated each concept separately in different wireframes to 
								make their point for topics such as proximity, similarity, closure, symmetry, continuation, and common fate. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed the similarity section the most. I liked that they pointed out the hierarchy of what people think of as similarity
								(color > size > shape). The visual wireframe helped make this point. This is especially helpful information when it comes 
								to grouping objects on a page and how to make them appear grouped without having to draw boxes around each group. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about communication, performance and convenience." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
