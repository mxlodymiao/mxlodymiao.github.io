            <li>I learned how to study the design of apps rather than simply scrolling them. 
                The article mentions specific examples of how to break down and observe components of an app.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the observations the author made of the Airbnb app such as the mention of "London" in the search bar. 
                The observations go beyond the aesthetics of the page. 
                I like how they studied how language affects a user's experience on the page.</li>
            <li>"Open up an app and think through the reasons why the designers chose to design it that way. By routinely analyzing 
                other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
