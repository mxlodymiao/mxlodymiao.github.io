                                From this article, I learned a lot of new ideas for interactive design.
                                There were many different types of interactions such as typing, swiping, scrolling, etc.
                                Seeing the interactions made me take notice of them as sometimes it's hard to notice and appreciate these interactions when using these apps.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>
                                I enjoyed looking at all the various interactions. I appreciated that they weren't too similar to each other. 
                                I also liked that the interactions were for different parts of an app such as the login, the menu bar, etc.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>
                                My favorite was the login screen interaction where the person was almost "eaten up" by the login. 
                                It was cool and unexpected.
                                The login's dark contrast with the home(?) screen effectively communicates that the user enters a different screen.
                                I also enjoyed the slow, moving background of the home page in contrast with the fast and unique manner that the login screen appeared.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>
                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p>7 - I enjoyed looking at the interactions but I wish there was text explaining the interaction and the app or site.</p>
                        </li>
