					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I thought that the concept of this article was very interesting because it suggests that there is evil that 
							can be done through a designers' work. I learned about many different types of dark patterns and how they
							can easily mislead people into behaving a certain way even without their own knowledge. There are tactics here 
							that I myself have fallen for in the past. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I liked that the article pointed out the specific companies guilty of certain types of dark patterns. 
							My favorite part of the article was when the author suggests an ethical code of conduct for designers to follow.
							I think it's interesting that although designers face a dilemma in helping both the company in making profits 
							as well as the user to make the product user-centered. </p>

						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "We help shape the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have significant impacts on the way we as a society behave. Giving in to dark patterns for meeting short-term goals is not the solution." </p>
