					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that whitespace creates breathing room around elements on a page and can help draw attention to these elements. 
								I also learned that while consistent spacing is important, sometimes its ok to leave extra space for more whitespace.
								For example, in the picture of the Wayfair website, although the heading is not flush to the edge of the page like the other elements,
								it is much easier to read. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed reading about Gestalt Principles. I liked the examples the the author provided of the layouts which showed how
								spacing can improve the visual organization of the page. Even though objects are grouped together, if they are too close to other
								groups, these groups can appear to blend together. </p>
						</li>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"White space is not wasted space."</p>
