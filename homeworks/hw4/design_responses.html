						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned about standards of colors that help create more accessible web pages.
								I was not aware of the standards and the lawsuits that could be filed due to inaccessibility in websites.
								I also learned to make things more accessible by not relying solely on color for important information on pages, 
								but to include other things (such as icons, pop-ups, utilize different font sizes, etc.) to convey these points.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of the article was the resources that are provided to check if contrast is enough.
								I have always been unsure about whether I am making wise design decisions when overlaying different colored elements,
								but with these tools, like Colorsafe, I have something to check whether the color contrast is enough to meet W3C standards.
								I learned about the 4.5:1 ratio but had no idea how to measure it--now I have a resource!
